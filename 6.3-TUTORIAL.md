## 1. Introduction  

This tutorial demonstrates a basic SQL injection against the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA).  
We will run DVWA locally using Docker, set the security level to **Low**, submit a simple SQL injection payload `1' OR '1'='1` into the SQL Injection page, and observe the application return multiple database rows.  
This shows how un-sanitized user inputs can allow attackers to bypass query filters and extract data — an essential concept in web security learning.

## 2. Prerequisites  

- Docker Desktop for Windows (running)  
- Git  
- Visual Studio Code

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions  

### Step 0 — Clone the DVWA repository  

1. Create a folder (example: `CSN190`)  
2. Copy the repository URL:  
: https://github.com/digininja/DVWA
#3.	Open VS Code
#4.	Open Terminal in VS Code
#5.	Navigate to your folder
#6.	Clone the repository

###Step 1 — Start DVWA with Docker Compose
1.	In the DVWA folder run:
2.	docker-compose up -d
3.	Verify containers are running (docker ps) or confirm in Docker Desktop.

Step 2 — Open DVWA and configure DB
1.	Open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:4280 (or http://localhost:4280).
2.	Login if needed (default: admin / password).
3.	Go to DVWA Security and set the security level to Low → Submit.
4.	Go to Setup / Reset DB → click Create / Reset Database.

Step 3 — Run the SQL injection test
1.	In DVWA left menu select Vulnerabilities → SQL Injection.
2.	In the User ID input enter the payload:
3.	1' OR '1'='1
4.	Click Submit.

Step 4 — Observe results and document
•	The page should return multiple rows showing the WHERE clause was bypassed.
•	Take a clear screenshot showing the returned rows (admin, Gordon Brown, etc.).
Screenshot: Multiple user rows returned — SQL injection success

4. Expected Results
If the injection works, the SQL query is evaluated as always true and returns all rows. You should see multiple user entries listed in red this proves input was not sanitized and the app is vulnerable.
5. Troubleshooting
•	No output / blank page → Make sure DB is initialized (Setup / Reset DB).
•	Payload sanitized / no rows → Verify security level is set to Low.
•	Docker fails to start → Restart Docker Desktop, check container logs (docker-compose logs web).
6. Conclusion
This lab shows how a simple SQL injection payload can return sensitive data from a database when inputs are not sanitized. It’s an essential hands-on demonstration for beginners to understand the importance of parameterized queries and input validation.
